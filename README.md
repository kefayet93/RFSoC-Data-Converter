This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebook files to implement a loopback configuration on the RFSoC 4x2 evaluation kit. The design transmits and receives continuous-wave (CW) tone using the RF-sampling DAC and ADC on the XCZU28DR chip of the RFSoC 4x2 kit. 
PYNQ is deployed on the processing system (PS) to communicate with the data converters and visualize the data for post processing.
